Virtual Targeting System for Kerbal Space Program
=================================================

This plugin gives all command modules the ability to set a virtual target marker. You can either pick
it on the map view or enter the target's coordinates manually.

You can access the Virtual Targeting System through the "VT" button in the toolbar.

This mod includes version checking using [MiniAVC](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745).
If you opt-in, it will use the internet to check whether there is a new version available. Data is only
read from the internet and no personal information is sent. For a more comprehensive version checking
experience, please download the [KSP-AVC Plugin](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745).
