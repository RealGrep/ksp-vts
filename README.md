Virtual Targeting System for Kerbal Space Program
=================================================

This plugin gives all command modules the ability to set a virtual target marker. You can either pick
it on the map view or enter the target's coordinates manually.

With this plugin you can more easily target a specific landing site, for example a certain biome that
you still need science from or a anomaly that has been found by the [SANsat plugin](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/249/SCANsat).

How to use
----------
You can access the Virtual Targeting System through the "VT" button in the toolbar. Here you can click:

 * *Pick Target Location:* Pick a location from the map view. Left click to select the target and set
   it as target for your ship/navball (pink marker). Leave the map view (shortcut: M) to cancel. Note
   that you can only select a target on the planet in whose sphere of influence your ship is.
 * *Set as Target:* Sets the virtual target as target for your ship/navball if you've selected another
   target.
 * *Delete Virtual Target:* Deletes the current virtual target.

You can also directly enter the coordinates in the fields below. Here you can click:

 * *Apply:* The to set the coordinates and activate the target.
 * *Reset:* Resets the fields to the values of the current virtual target.


Landing
-------
For landing on a planet *without atmosphere* I recommend you watch [Scott Manley's Tutorial For Beginners - Part 9 - 
How To Land A Rescue Mission On Target](http://youtu.be/38IYZUizX3E?list=PLYu7z3I8tdEmqpOkQZCl5SZB5t0vXuxE0).

For landing on a planet *with atmosphere* I recommend you install the [Trajectories plugin](https://kerbalstuff.com/mod/238/Trajectories).


Access to the Internet
----------------------
This mod includes version checking using [MiniAVC](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745).
If you opt-in, it will use the internet to check whether there is a new version available. Data is only
